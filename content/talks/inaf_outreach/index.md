summary: An outreach activity I designed for the course *Designing innovative public engagement activities* presented at the astronomy outreach festival in [Castellaro Lagusello back in 2022](https://www.astronomiacastellaro.oapd.inaf.it/edizioni-passate/edizione-2022/il-programma-2022). The main idea of this laboratory is to show children how matter accreted by a black hole emits light, and how astronomers manage to 'see' the black hole precisely thanks to its accretion disk. If you want to reproduce this experiment, you can find [more info at this link](https://play.inaf.it/illuminiamo-un-buco-nero/).
